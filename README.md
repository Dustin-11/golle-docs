# Golle
SMS-First Rideshare Platform for Amish & Rural Communities

## Purpose
Golle is inspired by growing up in the Amish country of Ohio and seeing how many community members choose to live without smartphones or cars. Despite these choices, many still rely on hired drivers, creating significant demand for accessible transportation. Traditionally, rides have been arranged through conventional methods like phone calls or text messages. Golle changes that by offering a rideshare platform designed specifically for these communities through building a foundation focused on delivering an SMS solution, without relying on smartphones.

The platform is built around action keys, which drive sequential workflows that guide riders and drivers step by step, ensuring reliability and ease of use even without modern devices.

The name “Golle” comes from the Ohio Dutch word for “horse”, honoring the original form of transportation and integral part of Amish tradition. Through the innovative solution Golle is offering, the Amish community will more easily be able to skip harnessing their horse to a buggy and instead ride Golle!

## Key Highlights
* SMS-first platform with sequential workflows driven by **action keys**.
* Supports both riders and drivers with minimal device requirements.
* Extensible architecture for future web/mobile support and additional services.
